this is my first line.
Here to learn about git and github, how to effectively work on it.
1. so far I have learm to make a folder into git folder by: git init
2. then to add it on stagging area: git add "filename"
3. then to commit, means saving that version: git commit -m "msg here"
4. When you are done, want to upload it to remote rep then git push.

Also, to make things simpler to understand: remote rap edit won't reflect on local rep unless you pull the code by the branch for the first time.
for first time you have to type: git pull origin master
then, git pull.
