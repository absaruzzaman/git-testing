this is my first line.
Here to learn about git and github, how to effectively work on it.
1. so far I have learm to make a folder into git folder by: git init
2. then to add it on stagging area: git add "filename"
3. then to commit, means saving that version: git commit -m "msg here"
4. When you are done, want to upload it to remote rep then git push.

Also, to make things simpler to understand: remote rap edit won't reflect on local rep unless you pull the code by the branch for the first time.
for first time you have to type: git pull origin master
then, git pull.

an overview
1. files in working directory: git init
2. to put the files in stagging area: git add "filename" or .
3. commit so that you can go back to any version that needed: git commit -m "msg"
4. finally uploading on remote rep, for that you have to make one if there isn't one in the github,
then using some commands to link up then verifying by git remote -v.
once that done, you can push and pull according to your needs. 
Example: now I am going to push from the local machine so now like I said:
git add . -> git commit -m "msg" -> git push
